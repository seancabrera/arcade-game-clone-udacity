main character into the water as many times as you can while avoiding the
bugs.

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.
Udacity provided the game engine and assets. I had to implement code to represent
the characters in the game (player and enemies), including code to move the
characters around and detect collisions. 

This project demonstrates proficiency in object oriented programming with Javascript, 
including ES6 classes.
